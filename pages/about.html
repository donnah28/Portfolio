        <div class="myLife">
            <p>I am a highly motivated and determined self taught web developer. Over the past year I have 
                been working on completing the complete Web Development Bootcamp with Udemy; this has helped
                 me to gain many skills and a vast majority of knowledge on both front end and back end web 
                 development. </p> </hr>
                <p>I have created many personal projects that involve me using many skills from html and css to
                 javascript and node.js. I am a hard working individual who loves problem solving, I am 
                 excited to start a career in the web development industry and am determined to further my 
                 skills and make it a long lasting career.
            </p> </hr>
            <p>I love both working individually and within a team, something I have learnt how to do very 
                effectively from my time studying Film Production at University.
                I have a passion for my hobbies in film and photography, both of which I think help me bring
                 an extra creative outlook onto all of the projects I create.
